# RxJS: some useful resources

When it comes to learn and work with RxJS I consider these resources and tools as helpful:
Resources and tools
The official API documentation (of course):

https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api
RxMarbles:

Visual and interactive documentation of most of the operators.

http://rxmarbles.com/
Rx Visualizer :):

Animated visualisation of an observable put together in the online code editor (very COOL!).

https://rxviz.com/examples/grouped-fibonacci
RxJS-Marbles:

Test your observables with marbles.

Learning

- Introduction to reactive programming (by Andre Staltz)

- Learn RxJS

Best case would be to delegate the Observer as far down as possible.

Just add the RxJS operations on it that you need and give it further down for it to be resolved only in the end
