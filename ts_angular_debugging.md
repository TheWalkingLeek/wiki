# ts_angular_debugging

Small debugging tips and useful tools while developing Angular apps.

- [augury browser addon](https://github.com/rangle/augury)
- `ng.probe($$('app-component')[0]).componentInstance` gets the current instance of the component
- `debugger;` works fine
- setting breakpoints in the browser works fine as well (in dev)
